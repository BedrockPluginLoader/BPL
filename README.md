# Welcome to BPL

BPL (Bedrock Plugin Loader) is a plugin loader designed for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers, specifically BDS (Bedrock Dedicated Server). Written in C++, BPL is in its alpha stage, and while it's not fully functional as a plugin loader yet, it represents an exciting new approach to plugin management for servers. We are aiming to evolve basic servers into a new perspective of servers.
