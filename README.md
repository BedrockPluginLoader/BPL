# Welcome to BPL

BPL (Bedrock Plugin Loader) is a plugin loader designed for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers, specifically BDS (Bedrock Dedicated Server). Written in C++, BPL is in its alpha stage, and while it's not fully functional as a plugin loader yet, it represents an exciting new approach to plugin management. We are aiming to evolve BPL into a fully-featured plugin loader by next year, bringing a fresh perspective to the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition community.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and refine BPL!
