## üìñ Introduction
BPL (Bedrock Plugin Loader) is a plugin loader designed for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers!</br>
Written in C++, BPL is currently in it's alpha stage, and that means it's not fully functional as a plugin loader yet.</br>
BPL represents an exciting new approach to plugins for servers with our plugins using a Sandboxed Environment with Lua.</br>


## üß© Features
*  **Performance**: We want performance in mind.
*  **Security**: Each plugin is in it's own Sandboxed Lua Environment with no direct OS/FS calls.
*  **Implementation**: You can easily implement this with any BDS server.


## üëë Development Progress
- [ ] todo :/


## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Information
BDS (Bedrock Dedicated Server) isn't developed by the BPL team, BPL itself only modifies the memory of BDS to allow as we call them "plugins" which only adds customization to certain things around BDS, BPL doesn't contain any malicious intent and plugins cannot be verified by us constantly checking for potential malware. BPL also isn't under the type of "cheats/exploits/hacks" for games.
